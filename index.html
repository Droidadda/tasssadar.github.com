<h2>Hi,</h2>

<p>I am young programmer(ish?) from Brno, Czech Republic. My real name is Vojtěch Boček, and <a href="https://github.com/Tassadar">somebody else with no activity whatsoever</a> has chosen same nickname as I did, Tassadar.</p>

<p>I like C++ the best, though I can do with Java and C#. I'm the open source-Linux-Android direction person - I recently got my hands on Apple's iPad 2, and it is horrible - it does not even have bluetooth SPP profile, not to mention the developer fee. Also, I like microcontrollers, especially little robots with MCU's inside, eg. <a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/975">3pi</a></p>

<p>Other than that, normal geek-ish person - playing Diablo 3, reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>, pale skin, very little social skills, you know it.</p>

<h2>Notable repositories</h2>

<h3>Lorris</h3>

<p>Lorris is <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt app</a> designed to be used when doing something with microcontrollers, like a toolbox or something. Example: you have robot with color sensor. You need to show data from that sensor somewhere. <a href="images/lorris.png">Lorris is that somewhere</a>.</p>

<p>That was the simplest example. It can do much, much more. See the slightly outdated homapage for details.</p>

<h3>Lorris_updater</h3>

<p>Updater app for Lorris, written in C++ and it is using WinAPI only, so that it can be as small as possible. It will just check Lorris' version, download ZIP file and extract it. Small, simple.</p>

<h3>bashoid</h3>

<p>Bashoid is Audio's project and I just made several addons. It is an IRC bot, written in java and it's main advantage is addon-like structure.</p>

<h3>3piControl</h3>

<p>Program for <a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/975">3pi robot</a> (eg. ATmega328P chip), which acts like RC car. It also shows some info on built-in display. More info in README.</p>

<h3>3piLib</h3>

<p>Library for <a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/975">3pi robot</a> compiled together mostly from their libpololu and avakar's Yunimin library. It is designed to be used as single header file, just include "3piLibPack.h" and that is all. Supports motor control, display, RS232, buzzer and more. There is a <a href="https://github.com/Tasssadar/3piLib/wiki">wiki available</a>.</p>

<h3>MultiROM</h3>

<p>MultiROM is a multi-boot solution for LG Optimus One. One ROM is in the external memory, other(s) are on the SD card. The most notable feature is boot manager, which allows you to choose ROM at boot time, and to play Tetris, even when your Android system is broken. See homepage and XDA thread for more info.</p>
